# HTML Entity Shortcuts TextMate Bundle

So, this is simple.

I find that I'm often having to type out &-r-s-q-u-o-; when I want a smart apostrophe in my hand-written HTML.

With these snippets in place in TextMate, you just type an apostrophe and hit the tab key, and it's converted into the proper HTML entity.

It also works with double-quotes, with a " and a tab.

To do the left-single-quote and the left-double-quote, just hit each key twice and then hit the tab key. So to do a left-single-quote HTML entity, type in '' and hit tab. To get a left-double-quote, type in "" and hit tab.
