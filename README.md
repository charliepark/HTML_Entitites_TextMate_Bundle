# HTML Entity Shortcuts TextMate Bundle

So, this is simple.

I find that I'm often having to type out &-r-s-q-u-o-; when I want a smart apostrophe in my hand-written HTML.

With these snippets in place in TextMate, you just type an apostrophe and hit the tab key, and it's converted into the proper HTML entity.

It also works with double-quotes, with a " and a tab.

To do the left-single-quote and the left-double-quote, just hit each key twice and then hit the tab key. So to do a left-single-quote HTML entity, type in '' and hit tab. To get a left-double-quote, type in "" and hit tab.

## How to get the bundle

Just click on the "downloads" link above, and you should be able to download the bundle. Once it's on your desktop (or wherever), just double-click on the .tmbundle file, and the snippets should be automatically added to your TextMate bundles list.
